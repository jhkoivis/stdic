# This data file contains information for scaling the camera pictures

#
### fileName is the folder name of the camera pictures.
#
### x_top, x_mid and x_bottom are the horizontal widths of the sample
# on top, mid and bottom of the sample as pixels. GIMP's measurement tool
# is handy when taking them.
#
### angleLeft and angleRight are the angles of the left and right
# vertical side of the samples (90 degrees is a straight side). In my
# scripts, they aren't used in the calculations, but they are more like
# notes for measuring x_0r and x_0l. They can be used for error
# calculating, though. Again, GIMP's measuring tool is handy.
#
### x_0r and x_0l are "measured" widths of the sample, meaning those
# pixel widths that are taken in the way that the measuring line is in
# 90 degree compared to the each vertical side of the sample. This measure
# implies how the x dimensions were actually measured before experiments.
# Again, GIMP's measuring tool is handy.
