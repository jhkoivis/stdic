# This file is for cropping the images for the DIC.
#
# Format:
# expname, rotAngle, maxImageNumber, x0, x1, y0, y1
#
### expname is the actually the name and path of the folder where the
# images are located.
#
### If needed (like when camera or the sample is upside-down), you can
# rotate the images with rotAngle. 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees should
# be safe.
#
### maxImageNumber tells what image is the last one. For example, even
# if you take every 10th image from images 0-1000, this number is 1000,
# not 100. WARNING! Despite the name, the "maxImageNumber" can't see
# if there is less images than the maxImageNumber value is. It doesn't
# understand  if the maxImageNumber is bigger than the amount of cropped
# images...
#
### (x0,y0) is the pixel coordinate of the upper left corner of the
# cropped area, and (x1,y1) is the lower right corner (taken from the
# original image). Notice the ORDER OF COORDINATES in the format!
